Diary: Advent of Code 2020
================
  
Notes about functions/arguments Iâ€™d not come across before. And any
other thoughts. Full solutions can be found in the solutions folder.

# Day 9

I wrote my first recursive function in about 10 years. Had huge success with it for Part I - much simpler than I feared it would be. Worked like a charm.

Wrote another recursive function for Part II, which worked for the test case but exceeded the stack limit for the real input. Thing is, recursive functions don't release stack memory until you heading back up. But my solution didn't do that, it doesn't come back up. 

One potential solution would have been to split my single recursive function into two recursive functions - one that changes the location, the other one that changes the range.

But another viable solution - and the one I ended up with - was avoiding function arguments and defining the location and range variables in the global environment. And then using `<<-` to modify these global variables directly.


# Day 8

This was a pretty standard if-elses typing exercise. At least the way I solved it. Will now head to Twitter to see what other people came up with.

# Day 7

Was able to use `library(igraph)` for the first one, but had to write a loop for Part II.

# Day 6

This was a nice data sciency day again. As usual, wrangling your data into the right format is half the battle. I wrangled the input into a tidy format with my usual best friends: `separate()` and `separate_rows()`. It helped that the format was very similar to Day 4.

Then some grouping, counting and filtering to answer both parts.

# Day 5

This was short and sweet - no need to try and step through the rows/columns, as the name of the puzzle hints, the row and column locations were given as binary numbers. R's function for binary to decimal is `strtoi(..., base = 2)`.

# Day 4

This was a pure data wrangling and cleaning problem so very convenient in R and tidyverse. Thinking I need to figure out the regular expression for `# followed by exactly six characters 0-9 or a-f` phased me for a second, until I realised this is a HEX code. So I searched online for "R hex code checker", which is a built in function. No regular expressions needed for this one.

# Day 3

To solve this one - a forest patch that repeats periodically - module operations/remainders are needed. I never encounter modulos in my work, the only reason I knew this is what to do is because I also did Advent of Code last year. In short, I only use the modulo operator (`%%`) in December :smiley:

The tricky bit to Part II was integer overflow: the result was just too big to be an integer. But the exact same number was fine as a double. So adding `as.numeric()` solved the integer overflow error.

# Day 2 

Today I learned that `between()` from `library(dplyr)` is not currently vectorised meaning it can give unexpected/wrong results.

Little example:
```
library(tidyverse)

tibble(min = c(2, 5), max = c(3, 5), value = c(4, 5)) %>% 
  mutate(is_between = between(value, min, max))
  
#> # A tibble: 2 x 4
#>     min   max value is_between
#>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <lgl>     
#> 1     2     3     4 FALSE     
#> 2     5     5     5 FALSE
```

The second row here should say TRUE - as 5 is between 5 and 5. But since `between()` is not vectorised it's maybe still looking at the min and max values from row 1: so checking it's between 2 and 3...

The GitHub version will no longer let the function run like this and [will error out](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/pull/5501). In the future, the team will vectorise `between()` so it will work as expected.

Meanwhile, two work-arounds:

One to add in `rowwise()`:
```
library(tidyverse)
tibble(min = c(2, 5), max = c(3, 5), value = c(4, 5)) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(is_between = between(value, min, max))
#> # A tibble: 2 x 4
#> # Rowwise: 
#>     min   max value is_between
#>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <lgl>     
#> 1     2     3     4 FALSE     
#> 2     5     5     5 TRUE
```

Or to spell it out using `>=, &, <=`:
```
tibble(min = c(2, 5), max = c(3, 5), value = c(4, 5)) %>% 
  mutate(is_between = value >= min & value <= max)
```


# Day 1

In part II, used used `full_join()` to combine three duplicates of the input lists, essentially creating permutations. To achieve that using `full_join()`, you'll have to join "by" nothing: `by = character()`.

I used a `full_join()` because it's quick and easy, and worked fine for the very small number of permutations this created: 200^3 so 8 million. I could have reduced the "computational burden" by using combinations instead of permutations. But this way was easy to type in, and evaluated in 1.1 seconds. So no reason to optimise it just now. I hope this doesn't become the basis of the whole month :smiley:
